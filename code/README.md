# Are Edge Weights in Summary Graphs Useful? - A Comparative Study

<!-- We conduct a systematic comparison between a weighted graph summarization model and an unweighted graph summarization model.
Our contributions are as follow:

* *Systematic Comparison*: conducting the first systematic comparison between two extensively-studied graph summarization models.

* *Unexpected Observation*: leading to a surprising observation that unweighted models are significantly better than weighted models.

* *Improvement of State-of-the-art Algorithms*: improving a state-of-the-art graph-summarizaion algorithm for the weighted model by adapting it to the unweighted model. -->
